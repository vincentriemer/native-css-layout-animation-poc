# Native CSS Layout Animation POC
A proof of concept implementation and demo of a layout animation system which utilizes native CSS layout and special React elements. This project was initially discussed and released at React Boston 2017.

## Caveats
* Currently, the only browser to support the required `ResizeObserver` API is Chrome Canary with the *experimental web apis* flag turned on.
* This PoC is leveraging behavior (firing events on position change) that is found in the Chrome Canary implementation of `ResizeObserver` but not its corresponding spec so there is a chance that this behavior will eventually be removed and break this demo.
* This implementation only is focused on the **change** of layout on existing elements at a single level. No work has been done yet on facilitating layout animations of mount, unmount, or elements with visible children.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project and install the dependencies like so:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To run the project execute:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

and navigate to `localhost:3000` in Chrome Canary to try out the demo.

### Note

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` so all npm scripts that are generated by it will also work here.
